         * This price curve can be broken down into three stages, 1) set up to allow a portion where managers
         * have control over the cadence of the auction, and then two more stages that are used to enforce finality
         * to the auction. The auction price, p(x), is defined by:
         *
         * p(x) = (priceNumerator/priceDenominator
         * 
         * In each stage either the priceNumerator or priceDenominator is manipulated to change p(x).The curve shape
         * in each stage is defined below.
         *
         * 1) Managers have the greatest control over stage 1. Here they define a linear curve that starts at zero
         * and terminates at the passed pivot price. The length of time it takes for the auction to reach the pivot
         * price is defined by the manager too, thus resulting in the following equation for the slope of the line:
         *
         * PriceNumerator(x) = auctionStartPrice + (auctionPivotPrice-auctionStartPrice)*(x/auctionTimeToPivot), 
         * where x is amount of time from auction start
         * 
         * 2) Stage 2 the protocol takes over to attempt to hasten/guarantee finality, this unfortunately decreases
         * the granularity of the auction price changes. In this stage the PriceNumerator remains fixed at the 
         * auctionPivotPrice. However, the priceDenominator decays at a rate equivalent to 0.1% of the ORIGINAL
         * priceDenominator every 30 secs. This leads to the following function relative to time:
         *
         * PriceDenominator(x) = priceDenominator-(0.01*priceDeonimator*((x-auctionTimeToPivot)/30)), where x is amount
         * of time from auction start. 
         *
         * Since we are decaying the denominator the price curve takes on the shape of e^x. Because of the limitations 
         * of integer math the denominator can only be decayed to 1. Hence in order to maintain simplicity in calculations
         * there is a third segment defined below.
         *
         * 3) The third segment is a simple linear calculation that changes the priceNumerator at the rate of the pivot
         * price every 30 seconds and fixes the priceDenominator at 1:
         *
         * PriceNumerator(x) = auctionPivotPrice + auctionPivotPrice*(x-auctionTimeToPivot-30000), where x is amount of
         * time from auction start and 30000 represents the amount of time spent in Stage 2
